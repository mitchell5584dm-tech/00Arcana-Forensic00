# Arcana Forensics
**Air-gapped digital evidence acquisition with a custody chain that survives its own machine.**

> Acquire. Seal. Anchor. Verify. — Read-only acquisition, authenticated AES-256-GCM
> vault isolation, a hash-chained custody ledger, and timestamp anchoring that lets an
> independent verifier prove your ledger existed *when you said it did* — without
> trusting us.

## Why Arcana
| | Arcana | Typical FOSS tools |
|---|---|---|
| Air-gapped operation | ✅ zero network stack | varies |
| Vault sealing | ✅ AES-256-GCM + Argon2id | often none |
| Custody ledger | ✅ SHA-256 hash chain + **external timestamp anchoring** | local chain only |
| Scope | ✅ acquisition only — destructive ops permanently removed | n/a |
